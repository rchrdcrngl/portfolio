{"pageProps":{"projectData":{"title":"RemCards Flutter","slug":"remcards-flutter","description":"A newer iteration of the RemCards app where I use Flutter as my platform of choice. It uses my own API which I have deployed on Heroku. I use MongoDB for the database. A Schedule feature has been added where the user can input their class schedule and the app would remind them of their class 5 minutes before the period. It does not support real-time updates of RemCards, as opposed to the Android Java version.","type":"mobile","technology":["Flutter","Dart"],"source_code":"https://github.com/rchrdcrngl/RemCards-Flutter","latest_output":"https://github.com/rchrdcrngl/RemCardsProject/blob/main/RemCardsApp-Flutter/remcards/apks/RemCards-FL220427.apk","images":[{"url":"https://github.com/rchrdcrngl/RemCardsProject/blob/main/RemCardsApp-Flutter/screenshots/RemCards%20Home.jpg?raw=true","description":"Home Page"},{"url":"https://github.com/rchrdcrngl/RemCardsProject/blob/main/RemCardsApp-Flutter/screenshots/Add%20Card.jpg?raw=true","description":"Add RemCard Page"},{"url":"https://github.com/rchrdcrngl/RemCardsProject/blob/main/RemCardsApp-Flutter/screenshots/Edit%20Card.jpg?raw=true","description":"Edit RemCard Page"},{"url":"https://github.com/rchrdcrngl/RemCardsProject/blob/main/RemCardsApp-Flutter/screenshots/Schedule.jpg?raw=true","description":"Schedules Page"},{"url":"https://github.com/rchrdcrngl/RemCardsProject/blob/main/RemCardsApp-Flutter/screenshots/Add%20Schedule.jpg?raw=true","description":"Add Period Page"},{"url":"https://github.com/rchrdcrngl/RemCardsProject/blob/main/RemCardsApp-Flutter/screenshots/Edit%20Schedule.jpg?raw=true","description":"Edit Period Page"},{"url":"https://github.com/rchrdcrngl/RemCardsProject/blob/main/RemCardsApp-Flutter/screenshots/Settings.jpg?raw=true","description":"Settings Page"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
